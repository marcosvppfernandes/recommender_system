              model

              id: this is used on the front end to link the label to the input
              name: this is used on the back end when you submit the form; it
                becomes the key in the params dictionary
              value: this is the default value of the input. not necessary but
                helpful for speeding up demos

              The <br>s between each label/input combo are a quick and easy way
              to put each one on its own line. They aren't necessary for the
              form to function but they help the flow without needing a lot of
              nested <div>s to achieve the desired layout

          The definition of a Board Game is pretty open, but normally the rules are clear, needs a mechanic to use during the game and some sort of definition of how someone can win in that game. We can find games that uses pieces, boards, cards, dice, coins, resources and nowadays we even have eletronics involved in board games.

          Recommendation Systems (also known as recommendation engines) are a relatively new prediction method that uses algorithms such as Collaborative filtering (CF) and Clustering that try to provide a number N of items (not yet interacted) for a specific user based on the correlation between users and what they had interaction with. In our case we initially try to implement a CF using a dataset with over 15 million rows.
